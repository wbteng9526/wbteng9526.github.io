<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm currently a third-year PhD student in [Vision & Graphics Lab](https://vgl.ict.usc.edu/) at [Institute for Creative Technologies](http://ict.usc.edu/), an affiliated institution of [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Yajie Zhao](https://www.yajie-zhao.com/). My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and graphics, with a focus on generative modeling and 3D reconstruction.
