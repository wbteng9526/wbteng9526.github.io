<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm currently a third-year PhD student in [Vision & Graphics Lab (VGL)](https://vgl.ict.usc.edu/) at [Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT)](http://ict.usc.edu/), an affiliated institution of [University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.usc.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [Yajie Zhao](https://www.yajie-zhao.com/). I was a Research Intern at SRI International Center for Vision Technologies (CVT) during summer 2024, working with [Dr. Supun Samarasekra](https://www.sri.com/people/supun-samarasekera/) and [Dr. Rakesh Kummar](https://www.sri.com/people/rakesh-kumar/). Before joining VGL, I received my Bachelor's degree with double majors in Mathematics and Economics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) where I conducted research in statistics and machine learning under the direction of Prof. [Allen G. Harbaugh](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=bOEC_rYAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and graphics, with a focus on neural rendering,image and video generation with diffusion models.
